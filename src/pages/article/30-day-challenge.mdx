# 30 Day Challenge

From the 29th of May until the 2nd of July I am going to do a 30 (ish) day programming challenge. The main purpose is to get me doing random
things to keep my brain active and to learn new things. I am also hoping that it will spark some creative ideas that I can work on in the future.

I've broken the challenge up into 4 main weeks and 1 "round off" week. When possible I will be trying to do write code in Rust.

### Week 1 - 29th May - 4th June

This week I will be attempting to do 3 different coding "katas".

1. [Gilded Rose](https://github.com/ardalis/kata-catalog/blob/main/katas/Gilded%20Rose.md) - bit of a introduction to the challenge and focuses
on test-first development.
2. [RPG Combat](https://github.com/ardalis/kata-catalog/blob/main/katas/RPG%20Combat.md) - a fun game based kata around building simple combat rules for a RPG.
3. [Zombie Survivor](https://github.com/ardalis/kata-catalog/blob/main/katas/Zombie%20Survivors.md) - a kata based around building a simple game to simulate a zombie apocalypse.

### Week 2 - 5th June - 11th June

I only have 1 thing this week and that is to rebuild one of my first ever games I made. It was a very simple tower defence game where you are
on a tower with enemies coming from all 4 sides. You have to run to each side and fire a weapon to kill the enemies. I will be using the 
Unity Game engine along with the Synty [Prototype Pack](https://syntystore.com/collections/frontpage/products/polygon-prototype-pack).

### Week 3 - 12th June - 18th June

Back to doing another round of kata challenges. This time only 2 since they look to be a bit more challenging.

1. [War](https://github.com/gigasquid/wonderland-clojure-katas/tree/master/card-game-war) - a kata based around the card game war.
2. [Trading Card Game](https://github.com/bkimminich/kata-tcg) - a kata based around building a simple trading card game, inspired by Hearthstone.

### Week 4 - 19th June - 25th June

A while ago I tried to start a challenge of making a game using a letter from the alphabet. I got to letter "B" before I stopped. The first game
wasn't all that great either.

Anyway, for this week, I am choosing any of the remaining letters and coming up with a project idea, it can be anything I want. Doesn't have to
be a game either.

These are the remaing words to choose from:

> Contain, Displace, Extreme, Frown, Glass, Hate, Inspire, Jelly, Knee, Leash, Mathematics, Nonsense, Orbit, Payment, Quality, Routine, Square, True, Unlawful, Variation, Worth, X-ray, Yard, Zero

### Week 5 - 26th June - 2nd July

This week I've called a "round off" week. I will be using this week to finish off any of the previous weeks challenges that I didn't get to finish.
If there is still time left I have a few more projects I want to finish off.

- Add more CMS examples to my [Pigeon Demo](https://pigeon-demo.vercel.app/)
- Finish off the Bat game I started in C++. This was apart of the initial ABCs challenge I started.
- Complete some [Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) certifications. I saw they had a few and thought why not.
- Make "The Cycle" - a narrative game idea that I've had for a while, I have the content written, just need to put it all together.
- Finish [Yeast Mate](https://yeast-mate.vercel.app/) - a sourdough starter companion
- Revisit rstmpl - a Rust based template generator CLI.

There is a bit of a theme with my challenges, if you haven't stop it already, majority of them have a focus on games. That isn't a coincidence.
I wanted to make these challenges fun and interesting, there are plently of katas out there, but they are all pretty boring. This way, I will stay
engaged and hopefully learn a lot more.
