# Jamstack Forms Suck

Title says it all, there really isn't a nice way to do forms in the Jamstack. I am not talking about building a form with React or whatever.
I am talking about the actual form submission. The part where you send the data to a server and it does something with it.
Not having access to a DB like with WordPress is kinda annoying, I guess you can fill up your Headless CMS with submissions, but if you're
getting a lot of traffic you'll chew up your limits. Also how do you handle automatic replies? Set up your own SMTP server, sign up for another
cloud service like SendGrid? Now you're paying for CMS limits & SendGrid limits. Lovely.

Oh I know! Embed some trash iframe with a form that has the UI of a early 1800 stone carving, problem solved!

Just trash.
