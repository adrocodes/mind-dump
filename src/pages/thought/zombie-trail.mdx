title: Zombie Trail
---

I had a bit of a idea for a narritive game. Imagine The Oregan Trail but zombie apocalypse. During your travels you'll be presented with 
random events that you'll have to make a choice on. These choices will affect your party and the outcome of the game.

However isn't of a fixed list of choices you can enter a command of sorts. For example, lets say you're being chased by a horde of zombies.
You can enter the command `drop child`, which will leave the child to be eaten by the zombies as a distraction.

Bit dark, but you get the idea. I think it would be a fun game to make. Or at least funny.
